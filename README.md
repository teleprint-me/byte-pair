# Byte-Pair Encoder

## Overview
The Byte-Pair Encoder (BPE) is a tokenization method for natural language processing. This repository contains an implementation of BPE in Python, inspired by the original paper [A New Algorithm for Data Compression Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.1045), the referenced paper [Neural Machine Translation of Rare Words with Subword Units](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.07909v5) and [Lei Mao's blog tutorial](https://leimao.github.io/blog/Byte-Pair-Encoding/).

## Features
- Tokenization using Byte-Pair Encoding.
- Vocabulary management and statistics.
- Token pair frequency calculation.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies (if any).
3. Run the code to tokenize text and analyze token statistics.

## Usage
- Detailed usage instructions will be provided in the codebase.
